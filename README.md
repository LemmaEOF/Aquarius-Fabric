Aquarius adds even more content and additions to the Update Aquatic. Currently implemented:

- Flippers - give you Dolphin's Grace while equipped, letting you swim faster.

- Channeling II and III - Channeling 2 lets you strike entities with lightning when it's raining or thunderstorming, and Channeling 3 lets you strike entities any time.

- Trident crafting and repair - craft Prismarine Rods to craft and repair tridents. More uses for prismarine rods coming soon.

- Chorus Conduit - lets you swim through the air and use Riptide while out of water.
